    <h1>Welcome to the landing page!</h1>
    <h2>We're start up that is cool!</h2>

    <p>We love that on Lyft's landing page, they zero in on their drivers' main motivation: earning money easily. We also love that, in addition to the "Apply Now" form, drivers can type their city and the number of hours they might drive for Lyft in a week
        to calculate how much they'd make. When visitors fill out that information and press "Calculate," they aren't taken to a new page. Instead, they see a dollar amount followed by a new call-to-action button to "Apply Now" (which, once clicked, takes
        drivers up to the form). By offering these two conversion paths, they're able to address two different types of people in the conversion path: those who are ready to make the decision now and those who need a little more information before they
        convert.

    <p>I don't think we've ever lived in a time when, culturally, we've been so food-obsessed. Poached has turned that into a B2B model with a platform to connect proprietors and culinary talent. When you visit the homepage, there's no mystery about what
        you're there to do -- the giant "Post a job" and "Choose a city" calls to action help with that. And once you click on one of them, you're taken to a no-frills form to become a member or log in, or a list of jobs in each city. It's colorful and
        comprehensive -- and, it makes us hungry.
